# Design-Patterns-in-C

**Practical Design Patterns in C**  

This will be a repository of
* Implement the Design Patterns of **GoF**(Gang of Four) in C.  
* (Version 1) Provide script to auto generate Design Patterns into different code style: C, pyNSource(ascii-UML), ... [C++, Java, C#]
* (Version 2) Reference from [Design Patterns in PHP](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans)

## C oop implement:

```

=================================================
+ have implemented
- can implemented with the "handle/body" idiom, but ...

```

## Quick Start:

```
Make a pattern
--------------

$ cd auto-gen
$ make
$ make runall
$ make clean_all

Auto Generate class
-------------------

$ cd tools
$ python gencode.py --file json/prototype.json > log   <<< the generated code in dir ./tools/code/c/prototype

```

## OOP basic:

The oop come from myobj.h:
* each class have it's special v-table, here is the struct ops
* the derive class should also have it's v-table instance, but same type with it's parent
* the derive class's v-table instance should initial with merge with it's parent

### Object
```
struct shape_rectangle *rect;

rect = malloc(sizeof(*rect));
if (!rect) return -1;
shape_rectangle_init(rect);
shape_draw(&rect->shape);
shape_free(&rect->shape);
```

### Class

```
struct shape_ops;
struct shape {
	struct shape_ops *ops;
	struct color * _color;
};
struct shape_ops {
	void (*_destructor)(struct shape *);
	void (*free)(struct shape *);
	void (*draw)(struct shape *);
	struct shape_ops *__super;
};
void shape_init(struct shape *);
```

### Data Abstraction & Encapsulation

```
struct shape_rectangle *rect;

shape_rectangle_init(rect);
shape_draw(&rect->shape);
shape_free(&rect->shape);
```

### Inheritance

```
struct shape_rectangle {
	struct shape shape;
};

void shape_rectangle_init(struct shape_rectangle *);
```

### Polymorphism

```
struct shape_rectangle *rect;
struct shape_circle *circle;

shape_draw(&rect->shape);
shape_draw(&circle->shape);
```

## Design Patterns:

* Using patterns can keep our code **loose coupling, cohesive code, and encapsulation**.
* Then we can write maintainable code with a high degree of **Orthogonality**.

1. Creational patterns
  * Factory
    - Static Factory
    - Simple Factory
    - Factory Method
      + GoF
      + two stage
    - Abstract Factory
      + GoF family objects
      + two dimension
      + three dimension
  * Builder
  * Prototype
  * Singleton
2. Structural patterns
  * Adapter
  * Bridge
  * Composite
  * Decorator
  * Facade
  * Flyweight
  * Private Class Data
  * Handle Body Idiom
  * Proxy
  * MVC
3. Behavioral patterns
  * Chain of Responsibility
  * Command
  * Interpreter
  * Iterator
  * Mediator
  * Observer
  * State
  * Strategy
  * Template Method
  * Visitor

The repository contains a folder by each design pattern.

  - call-ops: smaller client-ops
